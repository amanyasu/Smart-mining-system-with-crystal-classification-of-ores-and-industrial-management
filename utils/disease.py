        <br/> Cause of Properties:

        <br/><br/>Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that depends on two species to spread and develop. It spends a portion of its two-year life cycle on Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana). The pathogen’s spores develop in late fall on the juniper as a reddish brown gall on young branches of the trees.

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the ores <br/>
        <br/>1. Since the juniper galls are the source of the spores that infect the apple trees, cutting them is a sound strategy if there aren’t too many of them.

        <br/>2. While the spores can travel for miles, most of the ones that could infect your tree are within a few hundred feet.
        
        <br/>3. The best way to do this is to prune the branches about 4-6 inches below the galls.""",
